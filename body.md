# A Singapore AI Governance Concept Map

The Singapore government endeavours to make Artificial Intelligence (AI) a core national technology. Singaporeans will find AI increasingly interlacing in their everyday life. Yet, AI evoked is more than just a neutral technology, instead serving too as a socio-technical imaginary, a method to construct and promote certain possible urban futures.

Hence, this project seeks to map out the concepts of AI evoked by the Singapore government, charting connections between disparate bodies of knowledge distributed across the governmental body's many arms.

Such a semantic network will map out of the core concepts that emerge from a content analysis of 448 publications drawn from 79 different arms of the Singapore governmentâ€”16 ministries, 58 statutory boards, and 5 other governmental offices. The collection comprises 114 documents, 282 speeches, and 52 parliamentary QnAs.

# Augment

> Second, the Model Framework understands that AI is often used to assist in decision-making, whether it is to **augment a human decision-maker** or to make decisions autonomously.

> This paradigm shift is evident in organisations that have ventured into human AI-machine collaborations (HMC), re-imagining **how humans and machines can augment one another through collaborative intelligence**.

> When **AI is used to augment human decisions** or even to make autonomous decisions, the framework seeks to provide guidance on how to select the most appropriate decision-making model.

> At the same time, it **augments workers' capabilities, empowering them** to be more creative, analytical, innovative and emotionally intelligent.

> Relationships between students, teachers and parents, as well as capabilities of the physical infrastructure are augmented to create a holistic and conducive environment for effective learning.

> So it is **this combining of artificial intelligence with professional capabilities, this augmented intelligence**, that will deliver targeted, better quality healthcare for individuals, or deeply personalised healthcare.

> It is not about replacing workers with technology, artificial intelligence or robots, **it is about augmenting our workers with new skills, new technologies and new capabilities**.

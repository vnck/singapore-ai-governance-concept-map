# A Singapore AI Governance Concept Map

The Singapore government endeavours to make Artificial Intelligence (AI) a core national technology. Singaporeans will find AI increasingly interlacing in their everyday life. Yet, AI evoked is more than just a neutral technology, instead serving too as a socio-technical imaginary, a method to construct and promote certain possible urban futures.

Hence, this project seeks to map out the concepts of AI evoked by the Singapore government, charting connections between disparate bodies of knowledge distributed across the governmental body's many arms.

Such a semantic network will map out of the core concepts that emerge from a content analysis of 448 publications drawn from 79 different arms of the Singapore governmentâ€”16 ministries, 58 statutory boards, and 5 other governmental offices. The collection comprises 114 documents, 282 speeches, and 52 parliamentary QnAs.
